I'm currently a second-year PhD student in Engineering Mathematics at University of Bristol funded 
by [EPSRC-DTP](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=studentship-2920630). I received my MSc in Data 
Science and my BSc in Computer Science and Technology.

My research interests are broadly in the ethics and trustworthiness (e.g., explainability, fairness) of AI (LLMs, 
graphs).

*Data migration in progress, the alternative web can be found [here](jingcs.com). At the moment, have several different GitHub accounts: @[fairxai](https://fairxai.github.io/demo/TabularICL/index.html) (project-based), @[ym21669](https://github.com/ym21669) (current, teaching-based), @[jingcs](https://github.com/jingcs) (blue-sky, some non-tech notes).
